# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a video streaming platform (StreamHub) with user authentication, video upload/playback, social features (likes, comments, subscriptions), content discovery (search, categories, trending), and admin moderation tools.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for user signup and login
- Create user profile system with profile creation, editing, and viewing
- Build video upload functionality supporting MP4 and MOV formats
- Implement video streaming interface with playback controls
- Add social features: like system, comment system, and channel subscriptions
- Create video categorization and search functionality
- Build trending section based on views and engagement
- Implement watch history tracking and playlist management
- Create admin dashboard with user management and content moderation
- Build report system for flagging inappropriate content
- Design modern, cinematic dark theme UI optimized for video content

**User-visible outcome:** Users can sign up with Internet Identity, upload videos (MP4/MOV), watch video content with a player, interact socially (like, comment, subscribe), discover videos through search/categories/trending, create playlists, view watch history, and report inappropriate content. Admins can moderate content and manage the platform through a dedicated dashboard.
